# customer-churn-prediciton_ML
Predicting a custumers churn using ML 

Description

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques.
By analyzing customer data, we identify patterns and key factors that influence
churn, helping businesses retain their customers.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/David38mk/customer-churn-prediciton_ML
